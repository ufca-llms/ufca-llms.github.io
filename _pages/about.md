## About the group

UFCA LLMs is a research group focused on the study and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to problems relevant to society and industry. We work at the intersection of AI, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval, spanning methods and evaluation to prototypes and open tools.

The group is coordinated by Prof. Jayr A. Pereira (Universidade Federal do Cariri), bringing together students and collaborators interested in applied research and knowledge transfer.

## Research lines

* LLMs for knowledge retrieval and organization
* RAG and evaluation of conversational systems
* AI‑powered Assistive Technologies
* LLM metrics, safety, and alignment
