abstract = {Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems assist individuals with complex communication needs, allowing them to construct sentences by selecting communication cards. The facilitation of sentence construction primarily entails enabling efficient communication card selection. An approach to this involves using language models for communication card prediction. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of the AAC population poses unique challenges due to diverse vocabulary needs, suggesting one-size-fits-all approaches may be insufficient. This study introduces PrAACT, a method that leverages large, transformer-based language models, such as BERT, for communication card prediction. This method focuses on easy adaptability to incorporate user-specific vocabularies into the model. The method involves adapting a text corpus to the AAC domain, fine-tuning a transformer-based language model, and replacing the language model weights with an encoded representation of the user’s vocabulary. We conducted an assessment of PrAACT under both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. The performance of the models produced using PrAACT was superior to those pre-trained for the task. In addition, the main advantage of PrAACT is that it allows to quickly adapt a transformer-based language model to communication card prediction according to the user’s vocabulary.}

abstract = {This article introduces Instru\c{c}\~{a}o Assistida com Intelig\^{e}ncia Artificial (INACIA), a groundbreaking system designed to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into the operational framework of Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts. The system automates various stages of case analysis, including basic information extraction, admissibility examination, Periculum in mora and Fumus boni iuris analyses, and recommendations generation. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate INACIA’s potential in extracting relevant information from case documents, evaluating its legal plausibility, and formulating propositions for judicial decision-making. Utilizing a validation dataset alongside LLMs, our evaluation methodology, to the best of our knowledge, presents a novel approach to assessing system performance, correlating highly with human judgment. These results underscore INACIA’s potential in complex legal task handling while also acknowledging the current limitations. This study discusses possible improvements and the broader implications of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in legal contexts, suggesting that INACIA represents a significant step toward integrating AI in legal systems globally, albeit with cautious optimism grounded in the empirical findings.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to enhancing Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems tailored to Brazilian Portugues by integrating Colourful Semantics (CS) with transformer-based language models. We introduce an adapted BERT model, BERTptCS, which incorporates the CS framework for improved prediction of communication cards. The primary aim is to enhance the accuracy and contextual relevance of communication card predictions, which are essential in AAC systems for individuals with complex communication needs (CCN). We compared BERTptCS with a baseline model, BERTptAAC, which lacks CS integration. Our results demonstrate that BERTptCS significantly outperforms BERTptAAC in various metrics, including top-k accuracy, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Entropy@K. Integrating CS into the language model improves prediction accuracy and offers a more intuitive and contextual understanding of user inputs, facilitating more effective communication.},

abstract="This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law. The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Questions and Answers document published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais (CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics. Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency. These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes domains such as taxation. BR-TaxQA-R is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/unicamp-dl/BR-TaxQA-R.",
